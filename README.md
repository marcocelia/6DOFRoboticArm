1.Description

In this project the implementation of a robotic arm manipulator task with the
Matlab Robotics Toolbox is presented. In particular, an Anthropomorphic arm,
from now on Aarm, has been used. It has 6 Degree Of Freedom, from now on
DOF, then could be considered, at least in the first discussion, as a non redundant
manipulator since 6 are also the maximum DOF in a 3D environment
